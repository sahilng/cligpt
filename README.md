# cligpt (aka ?)

A quick and easy way to use GPT in the CLI.

To use, execute `?.sh` (prerequisite: Python).

Create a `.env` based on `.env.example` to save API key, model, and streaming preference.

Add `alias "?"="[path/to]/cligpt/?.sh"` to `.zsrhc` or equivalent, replacing `[path/to]` with the path to the clone of this repository.

Then, use `?` in your terminal to launch cligpt from anywhere.
